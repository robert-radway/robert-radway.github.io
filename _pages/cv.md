Research experience
======

**Meta Reality Labs, Silicon Research Intern**, Sunnyvale, CA, (Jun 2021- Jan 2022)
  * Analyzed AR/VR applications via Illusion System approach for multi-chip scalability (IEDM 2021)
  * Developed performance models for AR/VR systems integrated in 3D using TSMC’s SoIC technology.
  * Analyzed design tradeoffs for 3D integrated SRAM memory in AR/VR systems (IEEE Micro 2022).
  * Developed initial exploratory physical design flow to analyze system design choices & performance.

**Palacios Group**, MIT Microsystems Technology Lab, Cambridge, MA, (Aug 2015 – Feb 2017)
  * Research Focus: GaN-to-SiC HEMTs via Wafer Bonding:
    * Led development and simulated a novel GaN-to-SiC HEMT structure fabricated using wafer bonding to improve thermal performance (IWN 2016).
    * Led development of a GaN-SiC wafer bonding process to fabricate this structure (patent application).
  * Contributed to thermal modeling of REO epitaxies, fabrication of optogenetic sensors, and thermal simulation of vertical GaN devices. 

**Multicore Algorithmics Group**, MIT CSAIL, Cambridge, MA, (June 2014 – June 2015)
  * Collaborated with the Harvard Visual Computing Group to develop a deep network method for fast detection of synapses in neuron electron microscopy imaging.
  * Explored algorithms to turn synapse pixel segmentations to identifications.
  * Method showed up to 4x speed up over state-of-the-art.

**Personal Robots Group**, MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA, (Feb 2013 – Jan 2014)
  * Researched reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of human-based reward functions.
  * Created new algorithms to transfer results of previous trainings and explored their convergence.
  * Tested different approaches using Amazon Mechanical Turk studies.
