# Robert M. Radway

Bio
------------
Robert M. Radway is a candidate in the Electrical Engineering Ph.D. program at Stanford University supervised by Prof. Subhasish Mitra with expected graduation in June 2024. Before Stanford, he received a M.Eng. (advised by Prof. Tomás Palacios) and B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Robert's Ph.D. has been supported through the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF – as a Cadence Systems Design Fellow) and DARPA Three-Dimensional System-on-Chip (3DSoC – a ~$100M program to establish monolithic 3D integration of heterogeneous nanotechnologies in a US foundry). His research interests include new multiplicative scaling approaches for 3D MOSAICs (**M**onolithic, **S**tacked, **A**ssembled **IC**s), demonstrations of circuits and systems leveraging emerging devices, and heterogeneous 2.5D/3D and monolithic 3D integration.

Projects
--------
* **Multiplicative Scaling Approach for 3D MOSAICs**
  * Leading development of a parameterized application-to-emulation flow to demonstrate Illusion Scaleup via cycle-accurate system emulations. Flow leverages HLS and code-generation flows used to build MINOTAUR, an RRAM-based, Transformer-optimized accelerator SoC to generate parameterized Illusion Systems with variable per-chip capacities and chip-to-chip links. Application compilation uses a power-aware Illusion compiler (in preparation).
  * Led development of a custom, power-aware Illusion compiler for a multi-chip MINOTAUR system that leveraged fine-grained spatiotemporal power gating on chip to minimize application energy and latency overheads (in preparation).
  * Led development of Illusion Scaleup theory, finding just linear improvement pathways in on-chip and inter-chip technology were sufficient to match exponential growth in ML application demands when combined with Illusion Systems approach. Posited implementing this scaling through development of 3D MOSAIC (IEDM 2021).
  * Led development of Illusion Systems that provide the illusion of large on-chip memory (e.g., energy and execution time within 5% of a dream single chip). Developed multiple heuristic and exact binary integer programming techniques for ML partitioning on Illusion Systems. Developed custom hardware platform and multi-chip architectural simulations to demonstrate Illusion (Nature Electronics 2021). 

* **Optimized Architectures Leveraging Emerging Devices** 
  * Led physical design, packaging (including custom 16-chip package), and test platform for MINOTAUR. Developed spatiotemporally fine-grained power gating for dynamically adjustable (< 1us), energy-proportional RRAM bandwidth (in preparation).
  * Developed an iso-footprint and iso-capacity approach to 5-10x EDP benefits for 3D ICs (Carbon Nanotube FETs, RRAM and Si CMOS) vs. 2D ICs (RRAM and Si CMOS) (DATE 23).
  * Developed multi-chip Illusion System, led packaging and test platform development for CHIMERA, a RRAM-based edge AI/ML SoC demonstrating 2.2 TOPS/W peak energy efficiency, edge incremental training, 33us chip wakeup/shutdown, and 6 larger applications with <4% execution time and <5% energy overheads. (Symp. VLSI Circuits 2021 – Joint Focus Session, Best Student Paper Award, JSSC 2022). 
  * Measured on-chip RRAM IoT microcontroller with >10x battery life and fine-grained temporal power gating (>5,000x faster) vs. comparable embedded flash microcontrollers (ISSCC 2019).

* **Circuits with Emerging Devices – Resistive RAM (RRAM)**
  * Co-developed & measured first iso-footprint, iso-node, iso-performance, iso-reliability CNFET-RRAM vs. Si-RRAM memory cell (Symp.VLSI 2023, _Technology Focus Session_)
  * Led design of mixed-technology memory cells and arrays, leveraging RRAM, Oxide Semiconducting FETs and Silicon CMOS (in fabrication).
  * Led physical design of full-custom RRAM test arrays for 1T-1R and 1T-nR structures that demonstrated up 4-bits-per-cell storage (IEDM 2019, EDL 2021, IEEE TED 2021)
  * Transferred RRAM technology into SkyWater Foundry as part of the 3DSoC program, developed custom ATE programs to evaluate yield (ISQED 2023).
