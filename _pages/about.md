# Robert M. Radway

[Here is my short-form resume.](../files/Radway_RM_Resume.pdf)

Brief Bio (in the third person)
------------
Robert M. Radway is a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical Engineering at Stanford University supervised by Prof. Subhasish Mitra with expected graduation in June 2024. Before Stanford, he received a M.Eng. (advised by Prof. Tomás Palacios) and B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Robert's Ph.D. has been supported through the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF – as a Cadence Design Systems Fellow) and DARPA Three-Dimensional System-on-Chip (3DSoC – a ~$100M program to establish monolithic 3D integration of heterogeneous nanotechnologies in a US foundry). His research interests include new multiplicative scaling approaches on 3D MOSAICs (**M**onolithic, **S**tacked, **A**ssembled **IC**s), VLSI chip demos of circuits and systems co-optimized with heterogenous technologies, and heterogeneous 2.5D/3D and monolithic 3D integration. 

Research Interests
--------------
My research interests are in scaling system architectures via multiple multiplicative improvements:
  * Technology-optimized architectures for artificial inteligence / machine learning, augmented & virtual reality, and the internet of things
  * Heterogeneous 2.5D, 3D, and monolithic 3D integration
  * Heterogenous-technology systems electronic design automation & compilation

Projects
--------
* **3D MOSAIC (Monolithic, Stacked, Assembled IC) Systems that Scale via Multiple Multiplicative Improvements:**
  * Developed Illusion Systems that create the illusion of large on-chip memory (i.e., energy and exec. time within 5% of a dream single chip). Developed heuristic and binary integer linear program partitioning for ML applications on Illusion Systems. Developed hardware platform and simulations to demonstrate Illusion (**Nature Electronics ‘21, First Author**).
  * Developed Illusion Scaleup theory, finding linear improvement pathways in on-chip and inter-chip technology were sufficient to match exponential growth in ML application demands over a fixed horizon when combined with the Illusion Systems approach on a 3D MOSAIC (**IEDM ‘21, First Author**).
  * Developed parameterized application-to-emulation flow to demonstrate Illusion Scaleup via cycle-accurate system emulation using HLS and a power-aware Illusion compiler (leveraging fine-grained spatiotemporal power gating on chip) to generate parameterized Illusion Systems with variable per-chip capacities and chip-to-chip links (in preparation).
* **Technology-Optimized VLSI Systems:** Resistive RAM (RRAM) for edge AI/ML inference and training that scale.
  * Developed multi-chip system for CHIMERA, a RRAM-based edge AI/ML SoC with peak 2.2 TOPS/W energy efficiency, edge incremental training, 33us wakeup/shutdown, scaled to 6x larger models with <4% exec. time and <5% energy overheads (**Symp. VLSI Circuits ‘21 – Joint Focus Session, Best Student Paper Award, JSSC ‘22, Equal Contrib.**).
  * Physical design and custom 16-chip system integration of MINOTAUR, an RRAM-based, Transformer-optimized accelerator SoC for inference and training. Developed spatiotemporally fine-grained power gating for dynamically adjustable (< 1us), energy-proportional RRAM bandwidth (in preparation).
* **New Memories for Monolithic 3D:** Optimized ultra-dense (monolithic) 3D ICs integrating RRAM & CNFETs on silicon.
  * Iso-footprint and iso-capacity approach to 5-10x EDP benefits for monolithic 3D ICs (Carbon Nanotube FETs – CNFETs + RRAM + silicon CMOS) vs. 2D ICs (RRAM +silicon CMOS) (**DATE ‘23, Equal Contribution**).
  * First iso-footprint, iso-node, iso-performance, iso-reliability CNFET-RRAM cell vs. Si-RRAM cell, with apples-to-apples (same wafer) measurement (**Symp. VLSI Technology & Circuits ‘23, Technology Focus Session, Equal Contrib.**).
